# details 
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.

A version of depth-first search was investigated in the 19th century by French mathematician Charles Pierre Tr√©maux[1] as a strategy for solving mazes.[2][3]
